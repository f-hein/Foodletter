# Foodsletter_WL
Foodsletter is a simple POC mailing app providing you with the newest menu of Cockpeat Wroclaw and Astra Catering food courts located near West Link, Szybowcowa 2, Wroclaw.

### TODO:
~~Deploy this app on Heroku,~~ 

- [x] deployed on Raspberry Pi 3B+

~~Add the DB to store email addresses,~~

- [x] Edit: Emails will be saved to a text file

Create a mailing list:

- [ ] Add every sender's email to mailing list if emails body contains specific string,

- [ ] Delete sender's email from mailing list if email body contains specific string.

Other ideas:

- [ ] Create a footer containing a link to NGO action site, ie. Pajacyk by Polish Humanitarian Action

- [ ] Separate creating mail bodies from current code

- [ ] Add the instructions how to subscribe/unscubscribe from the mailing list to the mail footer
